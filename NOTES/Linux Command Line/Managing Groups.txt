// We need groups so that users in the same group have the same kind of permission

root@2cdada18eade:~# groupadd developers
// The group is added to /etc/group directory
    outuput: 
        developers:x:1003: -- 1003 is the id of the group

// Adding John (a user) to the group
// Every user has one primary group and zero or more supplementary groups
// Primary group is automatically created when we create a new user, it is the same name as the user

there are two flags for adding a user to a group:
    -g: Changes the primary group of the user
    -G: Adding user to a supplementary group

root@2cdada18eade:~# usermod -G developers john
