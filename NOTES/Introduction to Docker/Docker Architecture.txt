// Docker uses a client -> server architecture
    It's got a client component that talks to a server using REST API.

// The server is also called the Docker Engine takes care of building and running docker containers.

// A container is just a process

// Kernel is the core of the operating system
    it manages applications and hardware resources like memory and cpu

// The Kernel is reason why an application runs only on it's designated OS
    This is because the Kernels in OSs have different APIs to applications

// On Linux OS we can only run linux containers
// ON Windows OS we can run both windows and linux containers
    because windows officialy has a custom built linux Kernel
