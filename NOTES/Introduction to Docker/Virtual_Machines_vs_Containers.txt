HYPERVISORS
    VMware
    VirtualBox
    Hyper-V

Virtual Machines are resource intensive cause each runs a full blown OS
    and are slow to start.

CONTAINERS
    They give us the same kind of isoloation as VMs
    But they are more lightweight
    Use OS of the host
    Need less hardware resources
