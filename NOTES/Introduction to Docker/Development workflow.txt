STEP 1: dockerizing
// Dockerizing an applications means taking the app and make changes so it can be run by docker
    // We just add a docker file to the app

STEP 2: appliction --> image
// A docker file is plain text file that contains instructions that docker uses to package our app into an image
// The Image contains everything our application needs to run

// The image file might contain:
    A cut down OS
    A runtime environment
    Application files
    Third-party libraries
    ENVs

STEP 3: Image --> Container
// After the image has been created, we tell docker to start a container using that image
     A container is special kind of process because it has its own files system which is provided by the image

STEP 4: 
// Our application gets load inside a container, and this is how we run our app locally on a development machine

STEP 5:
// Instead of directly launching our app, we tell docker to run it for us

// We can push the image to dockerhub, which is like an remote repo and we can pull the image from any machine
