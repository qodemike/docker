// NB: When you try to run a container without a command to execute, it will start then stop.

CMD use this to specify the commands that should be executed on the container

// If you have multiple CMD instructions on the docker files on the last one will take effect

// Difference between RUN and CMD is that; RUN is executed during building the image while CMD is executed while starting a container

Shell form
CMD npm start -- writing like this will open another shell process

Exec form
CMD ["npm", "start"]

use ENTRYPOINT if you want to prevent overwriting commands during running the container, it works the same as CMD

but if you wanna overwrite the entrypoint command use 'docker run react-app --entrypoint npm start'
