// By default docker runs our application with the root user, this has the highest privilleges and anyone running the container can make changes
// If we want the one running this container not to be able to edit stuff,
    we add a new user and set that user when the container is run
// this way, we can manage that user's permissions on various files and folders

// creating group and a user 
RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app   -- create a group called app and add a user called app into that group, 
				  	    -- it is common practice for the group and user to have the same name on linux.
adduser
-S -- flag for setting a system user
-G -- flag for setting a primary group for that user

// setting the user 
USER app -- // commands that follow this layer will be executed using this user.
