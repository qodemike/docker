// You need to understand the concept of layers
// An image is a collection of layers

// Think of a layer as a small file system that only includes modified files

Each layer represents a set of file system changes and every dockerfile instruction adds a new layer to the image.

docker history vite-4 // cmd to see what layers were executed

// Instructions that change don't frequenty should be on the top of the dockerfile,
        while those that do should be on the bottom
