// We can embed COPY or ADD into the Dockerfile for this
// Although ADD has additional features

COPY /app/ -- all the project files will be copied to this directory, if it doesn't exist it will be created

// using WORKDIR the following commands , will be executed in this directory, this establishes a default directory in the image after build
WORKDIR /app  -- and also when we start the container this will be a our default directory ( we'll be here by default on container startup)
COPY . .  -- the first '.' is the location where we are copying from, the second '.' is the directory where we are pasting on the image

ADD -- add command has additional features
// With ADD we can add a file through a url
ADD http://www.example.com  -- with add we can get a file from a URL 
ADD file.zip    -- will also decompress a compressed file 

// filename with indentation
["", "", ""] -- COPY syntax if the file name has spaces
COPY ["hello world.txt",".","."] -- the first index is the name of the file, second is where to copy from and the last is where to paste in WORKDIR
