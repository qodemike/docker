Pulled images are by default tagged with latest keyword

Don't push an image with latest as a tag to your production or staging environment

WAYS TO TAG AN IMAGE

1. Tagging during build

docker build -t react-app

docker build -t react-app:3.1.5   -- teams that don't release oftenly use semantic versioning

docker build -t react-app:77      -- teams that release frequenty prefer build numbers, this can be done automatically with CI CD tools

REMOVING TAG
docker image remove react-app:1   -- type in the tag name

2. Tagging images after build

docker image tag vite-4:latest vite-app:1.0.0  -- to change the name and the tag of an image
