docker ps // to see running containers

docker run vite-app // the general command to run a container with the vite-app image

docker start vite-app // used to start any stopped containers, not to be confused with run

docker run vite-app npm start // since we defined "CMD npm start" on the dockerfile during building the image, we can use the CMD to do something special when starting the container 

docker run vite-app npm run preview // since it a vite application, this will run vite preview

docker run -d vite-app // -d for detached , to run a container in the background

docker  associates each container with a random name

docker run -d --name blue-sky vite-4 // if we want to run a container with our own unique name
