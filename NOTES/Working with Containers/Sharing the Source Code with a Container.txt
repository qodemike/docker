# Publishing application changes

For production:
    We should always build a new image tag it proper and then deploy it

# We can create a mapping between a directory on the host and a directory on the container
    This way any changes made on the project on the host are, immediately visible inside the container

# What we ran initially
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v app-data:/app/data node-docker:1.0.0

# The print working directory (pwd) will return a full path of the working dir on the host
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/app node-docker:1.0.0
